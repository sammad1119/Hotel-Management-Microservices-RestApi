# Microservices

Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where a large application is broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.
<br>
Key characteristics of microservices include:
<br>
Decomposition: Breaking down an application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality.
<br>

Loose coupling: Services are independent and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. This allows for greater agility and flexibility in development and deployment.
<br>

Independent deployment: Each service can be deployed and updated independently, without impacting other services. This enables faster release cycles and easier maintenance.
<br>

Resilience: Failure in one service should not bring down the entire system. Microservices are designed to be resilient, with mechanisms such as fault isolation and graceful degradation.
<br>

Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand, allowing for efficient resource utilization and better performance.
<br>

Technology diversity: Different services within a microservices architecture can be implemented using different technologies, languages, and frameworks, based on the specific requirements of each service.
<br>

Autonomy: Development teams can have autonomy over individual services, allowing them to choose the most suitable technology stack, development methodologies, and deployment strategies.
